        <h3>Photographer</h3>
        <p>Photography isn't about clicking for the moment. It is to tell a story. Make the someone stop, look, and take in what you are saying.</p>
        <p>
          After studying and practicing photography for 8 years, I have come to help others share what makes them excited through communication, understanding, and relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          You say you don't like to be in front of the camera. I say, "I am good at what I do. Really."

          <h3 class="consultant">Consultant</h3>
        <p>
          Not only have I worked in the corporate world, but I continually work with budding entrepreneurs and models; listening to their areas of opporunity and providing long term solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference with a consultant is a coach, is that I do the work for you but you must follow along and trust me.
